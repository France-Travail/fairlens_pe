``fairness`` (working title) is an open source Python library for automatically discovering bias and measuring fairness in data. The package can be used to quickly identify bias, and provides multiple metrics to measure fairness across a range of sensititive and legally protected characteristics such as age, race and sex.

``fairness`` enables data scientists to gain a deeper understanding of their data, and helps to to ensure fair and ethical use of data in analysis and machine learning tasks. The insights gained from ``fairness`` can be harnessed by the [Bias Mitigation](https://www.synthesized.io/post/synthesized-mitigates-bias-in-data) feature of the [Synthesized](https://synthesized.io) platform, which is able to automagically remove bias using the the power of synthetic data.
